SublimeLinter-pylint 1.3.0
--------------------------

 * New linting mode : the plugin will use the real file instead of a temp file
whenever possible. The temp file will only be used on an unsaved file, when
SublimeLinter is in background linting mode.
This allows pylint to correctly detect relative imports.

 * Whenever possible, errors are now positioned at the correct column

 * New options :
     - show-codes : display the pylint error code next to the message in the status bar
     - paths : a list of paths that will be added to the sys.path for pylint to look for modules
